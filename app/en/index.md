## What can you find here ?

The documentation is divided in four parts : 

1. [FAQ](/en/faq/)
2. [Howtos](/en/howtos)
3. [Console](/en/console)
4. [API](/en/api/)

## Convention

Console, technical words, menus and keyboard shortcuts are `highlighted`.

When buttons are dimmed in the console, it indicates that the function is not available.

Everytime you see an <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> icon in the interface, you can click to have help.
