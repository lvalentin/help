## What is Check my Website ?

Check my Website is a unique service for remote monitoring of websites and applications. It helps you to see the end-user point of view and gives you close insights on how to make your website « harder, better, faster, stronger ».

## What can you find here ?

The documentation is divided in four parts : 

1. [FAQ](/en/faq/)
2. [Howtos](/en/howtos)
3. [Console](/en/console)
4. [API](/en/api/)

## Conventions

Console, technical words, menus and keyboard shortcuts are `highlighted`.

When buttons are dimmed in the console, it indicates that the function is not available.

Everytime you see an <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> icon in the interface, you can click to have help.

The number of locations, time windows shown in the console may depend on the service subscription you have. See coming plans for available options.
