We try to make our best to provide settings and checks with sensitive default values. That's mean less things to do for you. You cant trust the default values to ensure maximum value of the Check my Website service.

You can change any setting by clicking on the value of the setting to change it.

## The settings menu

Just under the navigation tabulations, you can find the settings menu.

![Check my Website console settings menu](/assets/img/fullsize/en/console/website-settings/settings-menu.png)

From left to right, you can find;

1. The `Disable` button to temporaly or defintively disable a website check. When clicked, the website will **not** be monitored anymore.
2. The `Remove` button to just do that. A removed website will **not** appear anymore in the console.
3. The `Rechedule check` button. You can ask an immediate reschedule for a check by clicking on this button.
4. The `Advanced mode` lets you switch to the Advanced settings page. This is in fact the same page with more options.

## The general panel

The general panel helps you enter a URL for the website to check and a few other options.

## The locations panel

The locations panel makes it easy to choose locations from where the checks will be executed. On Check my Website, checks are done in parrallel on these locations.

The maximum number of locations you can choose depends on the subscription level you have with the service. Check the [plans](/http://www.checkmy.ws/en/pricing/) to see available options.
