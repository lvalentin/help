## The menu

The menu bar is the first part shown from the top of the console.

From left to right, you can find in that menu bar :

- The Chek my Website logo. Click on it to go to the [global overview](/en/console/overview/).
- An <i class="fa fa-plus-square pointer"></i> icon. You can then add anytime a new website to monitor. The number of websites you can monitor depends on your [subscription level](http://www.checkmy.ws/en/pricing/) to the service.
- An <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i> icon allows you to refresh the whole console screen.
- An <i class="fa fa-comments"></i> icon. You can get in touch with us by clicking this icon.

This screen appears once clicked on the <i class="fa fa-comments"></i> icon.

Just choose if you want to ask something « question » or give feedback on a problem you may have encountered « issue », decribe your problem or question and click `Send` to send the message. You will be answered… For sure !

The last menu on the right is maybe the most important one.

## The navigation

The navigation consists of small screenshots of all the websites you monitor with the Check my Website service.

Each of the screenshot is bordered with a thin line, which color represents the website state. See [definitions](/en/terms-definitions/) to know the possible states for a website.

The selected website in the console is a bit bolder than the other ones.

The big <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> icon allows you to add a new website to monitor.

The right bottom corner of each screenshot displays the [response time](/en/terms-definitions/#response-time) of each website.

You can scroll up and down in the navigation to see websites not displayed. You may have to scroll or not depending on how much websites you monitor and how wide is you screen.
